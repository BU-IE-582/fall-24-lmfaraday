# Homeworks and Project

## Homework 1

This homework uses simple machine learning techniques to predict antenna performance for 5G systems, focusing on the S11 parameter for signal reflection. By applying PCA and regression, we simplify complex relationships between antenna geometry and behavior. The repo includes code, data analysis, and a report with insights.
